README:
	The program will run in CMD with the following command:
	java -jar Assignment2_GA.jar.
	Make sure that the initial sudoku file is in the same folder as the jar file. 
	When entering the file name enter the file extension ".txt" as well.

Additional notes:
	I recommend restarting the program a few times if takes a while to solve or 
	if the best fitness value converges to a low number and just sits there.

	The code is in the 'source code' folder. ᴾˡᵉᵃˢᵉ ᵈᵒⁿ'ᵗ ʲᵘᵈᵍᵉ ᵗʰᵉ ᶜᵒᵈᵉ :)
